# Show-Build Development History

This document tracks major development milestones and completed features for the Show-Build application.

## 2025-01-XX - Multi-Site Database Redundancy System

### Major Achievement: Enterprise Database Infrastructure
Complete implementation of redundant database servers across multiple colocated sites.

**Components Delivered:**
- PostgreSQL primary/replica configuration for 5 sites
- WireGuard VPN mesh networking setup
- Web-based setup interface with 4-step configuration wizard
- Automated backup and recovery system
- Comprehensive documentation and deployment guides

**Technical Details:**
- **Primary Site**: Ravena, NY (10.0.1.0/24) - Read/write PostgreSQL 15
- **Replica Sites**: Burlington VT, Montpelier VT, Nantucket MA, Tucson AZ
- **Replication**: Streaming replication with configurable sync/async modes
- **Security**: WireGuard VPN encryption between all sites
- **Monitoring**: Real-time health checks and replication lag monitoring

**Files Created:**
- `docker-compose.postgres-primary.yml` - Primary database server
- `docker-compose.postgres-replica.yml` - Replica database servers
- `postgres-config/` - PostgreSQL configuration templates
- `app/setup_router.py` - Setup API endpoints
- `disaffected-ui/src/views/SetupView.vue` - Setup interface
- `scripts/backup-database.sh` - Backup automation
- `MULTI_SITE_SETUP.md` - Complete deployment guide

**Router Integration:**
- Setup router added to FastAPI application
- Setup route added to Vue router with database connection guard
- Automatic redirect to `/setup` if system not configured
