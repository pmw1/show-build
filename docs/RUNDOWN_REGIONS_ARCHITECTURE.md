# Rundown Regions Architecture

## Overview

Rundown Regions introduce a hierarchical structure to broadcast rundowns, providing both organizational framework and content governance. This architecture separates structural organization (regions) from content placement (items), enabling template-driven workflow management.

## Core Concepts

### Two-Layer Structure

**Top Layer**: Traditional rundown items (PKG, VO, SOT, Interview, etc.)
**Bottom Layer**: Rundown regions (BLOCK A, BLOCK B, BLOCK C) that act as containers

Rundown items visually and logically "drop into" or "sit within" these regions, creating a structured yet flexible content organization system.

### Region Naming Convention

Regions follow alphabetical naming pattern: **BLOCK A**, **BLOCK B**, **BLOCK C**, **BLOCK D**, etc.

- Provides predictable, intuitive ordering
- Natural progression that everyone understands  
- Scalable from simple (A-C) to complex (A-H+) shows

## Template-Driven Region Rules

### Show Template as Rulebook

Each show template defines:

- **Region Count**: Which regions exist (A-D, A-F, etc.)
- **Content Rules**: What item types are allowed in each region
- **Quantity Constraints**: Minimum/maximum items per region
- **Item Requirements**: Required vs optional items per region
- **Sequencing Rules**: Item ordering within regions

### Template Examples

#### News Show Template
```
BLOCK A: Headlines/Teases (2-4 tease items required)
BLOCK B: Main Stories (PKG, VO, Interview only, 3-6 items)
BLOCK C: Weather/Sports (1 weather required, 0-2 sports optional)
BLOCK D: Closing (Credits, closing remarks)
```

#### Talk Show Template
```
BLOCK A: Intro/Monologue (1 opener required)
BLOCK B: Guest Segment (Interview items, 2-4 segments)
BLOCK C: Break Content (Ads, promos as needed)
BLOCK D: Wrap-up (Closing, credits)
OPTIONAL BLOCKS E-F: Additional guest segments
```

#### Magazine Show Template
```
BLOCK A: Show Open (Teases, intro)
BLOCK B: Feature Story (PKG, interviews)
BLOCK C: Lifestyle Segment (Various content types)
BLOCK D: News Brief (Headlines, updates)
BLOCK E: Closing Segment (Wrap-up, credits)
```

### Template Limitations and Governance

Templates can enforce structural constraints:

- **Fixed Block Count**: "News template requires exactly blocks A-D"
- **Flexible Range**: "Talk show allows 3-6 blocks (A-C minimum, D-F optional)"
- **Minimum Requirements**: "Magazine show requires minimum A-E blocks"
- **Maximum Limits**: "Breaking news template prohibits more than 2 blocks (A-B only)"

## Implementation Benefits

### For Producers
- **Clear Structure**: Visual organization with logical content zones
- **Template Guidance**: Rules prevent common workflow errors
- **Flexibility**: Content variety within structured framework
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across show types

### For Content Management
- **Validation**: Template rules ensure rundown completeness
- **Workflow**: Clear handoffs between production stages
- **Planning**: Predictable structure aids scheduling
- **Quality Control**: Automatic checking against template requirements

### For System Architecture
- **Scalability**: Templates can grow from simple to complex
- **Reusability**: Region patterns work across show types
- **Maintainability**: Centralized template management
- **Integration**: Works alongside existing item type system

## Technical Considerations

### Database Structure
- Regions as containers with alphabetical identifiers
- Items maintain parent-child relationship with regions
- Templates store region rules and validation logic
- Flexible schema supports variable block counts

### UI/UX Implications
- Visual region boundaries in rundown editor
- Drag-and-drop respects region constraints
- Template validation provides real-time feedback
- Region-aware content organization tools

### Migration Strategy
- Backward compatibility with existing rundowns
- Gradual rollout per show template
- Legacy import tools for existing content
- Training materials for new region-based workflow

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Region Features
- **Sub-regions**: BLOCK A1, A2, A3 for complex segments
- **Conditional Blocks**: Regions that appear based on content rules
- **Dynamic Ordering**: Algorithm-suggested region sequences
- **Cross-References**: Regions that reference other regions

### Template Intelligence
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered content recommendations per region
- **Usage Analytics**: Data-driven template optimization  
- **A/B Testing**: Compare template effectiveness
- **Automated Validation**: Real-time compliance checking

## Implementation Priority

This architecture represents a significant enhancement to the current rundown system. Implementation should be approached in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Region data structure and basic template engine
2. **Phase 2**: UI integration with existing rundown editor
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced validation and workflow features
4. **Phase 4**: Analytics and optimization tools

The regions architecture builds upon the existing single-source-of-truth item types system, creating a comprehensive content management framework for broadcast production.
